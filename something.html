        Enjoy!
        
        </p>
    <p>   No Chill:
                Acting without regard to how others feel or see you. Saying or doing what you want without giving a f***. </p>
                <p> Example: 
                Rob got No Chill. He told the crippled kid to run faster and asked the autistic girl if she was retarded. </p>

        
        <p>Raggedy: Slang word for torn up, meesed up, nasty, and really ugly.<p>
                <p> Example: "Don't bring yo raggety-a** self in here, leave your dirty a** outside."</p>
        

        <p>Pass Out: To become unconscious; to faint.</p>
                <p>Example: We all saw Theo pass out when he accidentally sat on his own testicles.</p>


        <p>Flop: Something that fails miserably.</p>
                <p>Example: The last couple seasons of Game of Thrones was the biggest flop.</p>
        
        <p>Feminazi: A woman who, instead of supporting gender equality, supports sexism.</p>
                <p>They think wearing a bra is letting men oppress women, they don't want you to say "Hey Guys!" or "Hey Girls!" to them, and they sure as hell can't stand men. There's a big difference between fighting for equal rights and just being a bully.</p>

        <p>Giggity: A word used to point out a phrase that could be turned into something sexual, similar to "Thats what she said". Originated from Glenn Quagmire on Family Guy.</p>
                <p>Example: Me, playing Terraria: damn, This boss is so hard!</p>
                <p>         Weird Friend: Giggity.</p>
